# PanoptoStrip
This is a web browser extension to make panopto recordings more suitable for split screen display.

Currently using it for Firefox extensions but should also work for chrome since its based on it.
## To install locally for firefox:
1. Go to the url and type: about:debugging
2. There should be a 'Temporary Extensions' section.
3. Press 'Load Temporary Add-on...' and navigate to the git repo.
4. Load one of the files from src, either 'manifest.json' or 'PanoptoStrip.js'

This should resize to a half screen display. May look out of place, if so, change margins in 'PanoptoStrip.js'.
